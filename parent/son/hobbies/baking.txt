To bake a Beef Wellington, follow these steps.
First, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
Next, season a whole beef tenderloin with salt and pepper. Heat some oil in a skillet over high heat and sear the beef on all sides until browned. This will help seal in the juices and add flavor. Remove the beef from the skillet and let it cool.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling for the Wellington. In the same skillet, melt some butter and sauté finely chopped mushrooms, minced garlic, and thyme until the mushrooms are cooked and any liquid has evaporated. Set the mushroom mixture aside.
Now, roll out a sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface to a size that can wrap the beef completely. Place the cooled beef on top of the pastry and spread a layer of pâté or mustard over the beef. Then, evenly spread the mushroom mixture on top.
Gently fold the pastry over the beef, sealing all the edges. Trim any excess pastry if needed, and use the back of a fork to press down the edges for a decorative effect.
Transfer the wrapped beef Wellington onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Beat an egg and brush it over the pastry for a golden color when baked. You can also make decorative cuts on the pastry if desired.
Place the baking sheet with the Wellington into the preheated oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.
Once cooked, remove the Beef Wellington from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. This allows the meat to retain its juices.
Serve the Beef Wellington slices on individual plates, accompanied by your choice of sides such as roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes.
Enjoy this delicious and elegant dish!
